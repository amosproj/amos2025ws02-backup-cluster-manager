Creating an MVP for our industry partner SEP which implements an alternative approach for managing distributed nodes. 
It offers an UI for editing and overview data from nodes as well as users and their permissions. 
The backend simulates backup nodes and how nodes will interact with each other. 
Frontend communicates with the backend to get/edit/delete data such as users, permissions as well as backups & cluster information.
