The repository layer for the CM reuses the Mybatis mapper interfaces from the shared.repository-module for limited code duplication, but they are configured with a different datasource.
Bean creation for the CM repository layer is defined in com.bcm.cluster_manager.config.datasource.DataSourceCMConfig.java.
Call userMapper, groupMapper and userGroupRelationMapperCM with a CM suffix to distinguish them from the shared mappers e.g. userMapperCM and create a Constructor with Qualifier-Annotations.
