# This workflow
#   • Provides a reproducible, automated build and test process
#     for the Spring Boot backend service.
#   • Runs on every branch
#
# What it does:
#   1. Checks out the repository.
#   2. Sets up a Java 21 environment (Temurin distribution)
#      and caches Maven dependencies for faster builds.
#   3. Runs a clean Maven package build (skipping tests) to
#      verify compilation and dependency correctness.
#   4. Executes all unit and integration tests under
#      src/test/java using `mvn test`.
#   5. Generates JaCoCo coverage badges for line and branch coverage.
#   6. Commits and pushes updated badges to the repository.
