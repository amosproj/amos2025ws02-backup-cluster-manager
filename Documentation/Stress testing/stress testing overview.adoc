Stress-test high number of backups per node:
- Having only one node
- Start with 100 Backups
- Add 100 Backups per iteration (or more)
Monitor:
- Storage utilization
- CPU utilization
- API response time for backups endpoint with specific search queries
Concerns:
- Hardware resources

Stress-test high number of backups + high number of nodes:
- Initialize a high number of backups and nodes
- Start with 5 Nodes
- Add 5 Nodes per iteration (or more)
- Per node iteration test with 1.000 Backups/Node, 100.000 Backups/Node and 1.000.000 Backups/Node
Monitor:
- Storage utilization
- CPU utilization
- API response time for backups endpoint with specific search queries
Concerns:
- Hardware resources

Concurrent backup creation and deletion
- Initialize with 1 Node
- Many concurrent create-backup and delete-backup requests
- Start with 100 concurrent requests (create/delete)
- Add 100 requests per iteration (or more)
Monitor:
- CPU utilization
- API response time for create/delete request
- Check data integrity after tests are finished

Concurrent tasks creation:
- Initialize with 1 Node
- Many concurrent create-task requests
- Start with 100 concurrent creation-requests
- Add 100 requests per iteration (or more)
- Has to be checked if this is just a duplicate of "Concurrent backup creation"
